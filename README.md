# IT Portfolio

This is a portfolio to keep some of my college assinments and personal projects organized

## Description

A cool way to show others some of my projects and interets.
Most of the projects here will only talk about the theory behind what I did but I will provide a github link if you would like to see some of the code.
Some of the topics aproached here are AI, criptography, web dev amongst other things!
